# 8-Tasks-React

This app allows me to explore React core feature, like Custom Hook, and how I build this Hook. In this app i used all React concepts, which used in all apps, like: sendind requests with fetch API, handling errors and a loading state, transforming  data when it arrives and then displaying the data.
